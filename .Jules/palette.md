## 2024-05-24 - Add ARIA label to icon-only "Add Blocked Site" button
**Learning:** Found an icon-only button (a button containing just a `<Plus>` icon from `lucide-react`) in `src/components/focus/focus-mode.tsx` that lacked an `aria-label` attribute. This is a common accessibility issue that prevents screen readers from announcing the button's purpose to visually impaired users.
**Action:** Always verify that `<Button size="icon">` or similar buttons that do not have visible text content include a descriptive `aria-label` attribute to ensure accessibility. Also ensure unescaped quotes in JSX are fixed to avoid linting warnings.
